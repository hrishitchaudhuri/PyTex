# Text Based Game in Python
Submitted to  PES University as part of the requirements for completing Semester I for a Bachelor's degree in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (Batch of 2023).

<br />
Contains code for hangman, movement within a room using WASD, hot-cold meter, and timer mechanism.


# Future Work
Want to convert into a full-fledge interactive fiction module a la 'The Dreamhold'. Could be done since most mechanisms are down-pat.
